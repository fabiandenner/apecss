This example builds a standalone APECSS code for a monodispersed cluster of 250 interacting microbubbles. The cluster has a spherical shape with radius $R_{\mathrm{C}} = 232 \ \mu\mathrm{m}$, with the bubbles randomly distributed inside. The bubbles initial radius is $R_{0} = 2 \mu\mathrm{m}$. The incident wave is a single tension pulse defined by $p_{\mathrm{a}}(t) = -(p_{0} - p_{\mathrm{ng}})\sin^{2}\left(\pi t / \tau \right)$, with $\tau = 1.75 \ \mu\mathrm{s}$ and $p_{\mathrm{ng}} = -3.0 \times 10^{4} \ \mathrm{Pa}$. The computations are done with several interaction models : *no interactions* ("NI"), *incompressible interactions* ("IC") or *quasi-acoustic interactions* ("QA"). Each interaction model has its own repository for gathering data. The [run_sphericalclustertensionwave.sh](run_sphericalclustertensionwave.sh) file provides the whole execution command to run all computations, plot the results and clean the folders.

The quasi-acoustic model computation is done using parallelization, and takes around **30 minutes** to finish when running on 12 cores of an Intel 13th-Gen i7-13700K x 24 processor. The number of cores used can be changed in the header section of [run_sphericalclustertensionwave.sh](run_sphericalclustertensionwave.sh).
