This example builds a standalone APECSS code for two interacting microbubbles, following the work of [Ida, M. (2009). Multibubble cavitation inception. Physics of Fluids, 21(11), 113302.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3265547), using the _standard incompressible model_ and the developped _quasi-acoustic model_ to compute the acoustic emissions and interactions. There are three folders, representing each a specific interaction model ("NI" for "no interaction, "IC" for the _standard incompressible model_ and "QA" for the _quasi-acoustic model_). Each folder contains a [run.apecss](./IC/run.apecss) file to reproduce the bubble dynamics shown in Figs. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of the paper of Ida such as a [gather_results.py](./IC/gather_results.py) to properly keep the results. The [run_cavitationonset.sh](./run_cavitationonset.sh) file provides all execution commands required to gather data in order to reproduce results from the article. The plots are designed to exhibit the differences between the two interaction models when studying cavitation onset and collapse of the bubbles.
