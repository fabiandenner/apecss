This example builds a standalone APECSS code for two interacting microbubbles, following the work of [Ida, M. (2009). Multibubble cavitation inception. Physics of Fluids, 21(11), 113302.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3265547), using the _standard incompressible model_ and the newly developped _quasi acoustic model_ to compute the acoustic emissions. There is three folders, representing each a specific interaction model ("NI" for "no interaction, "IC" for the _standard incompressible model_ and "QA" for the _quasi acoustic model_). Each folder is containing a provided [run.apecss](./IC/run.apecss) file to reproduce the bubble dynamics shown in Figs. 5, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13 of the paper of Ida such as a [gather_results.py](./IC/gather_results.py) to properly keep the results. The [run_cavitationonset.sh](./run_cavitationonset.sh) file provides the whole execution commands needed to gather data in order to reproduce results from the source article. The plots are designed to exhibit the differences between the two interaction models when studying cavitation onset and collapse of the bubbles.
